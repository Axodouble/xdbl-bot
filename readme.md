# the xdbl bot
This bot is not necessarily simple, however this is a bot system for Discord that I have made from scratch and specifically tailored to my (sometimes odd) needs.

Now I initially didn't want to open-source this project, but I have decided to do so to remain transparent with the bot itself, but also to encourage others to look at my code, modify it, and learn from it.
